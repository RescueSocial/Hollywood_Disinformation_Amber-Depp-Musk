# Subjective Preliminary Claims
<b>Here are claims behind the Private Sector Disinformation related to risks correlating to the motivations, the high-volume, the crimes, and the devastation... 
- To save a life - and other lives these services can ravage at far lower volume due to less resilience - see attachments, leads, and read the below to understand the modus operendi, traits, risks, origins, and signs.
 <br>These interpretations are largely unseen due to the influence operations of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations/">Category 6</a> - also going to in-person where both sides are influenced against her. </b>
- We're creating precedents to have this as a public research study. Connect to Folder <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins">"Study Case - Effects, Risks, Origins."</a>
<br><i>- The bigger the challenge, the greater the opportunity -</i> <i>Be an ethical "person that takes time out to check on others, no matter who they are"</i>

By researching and providing community aid when there's an operation or abuse of coercive control in-progress, you could save a life. Here are the layers underneath where an operation comes from, how it harms others and stems from decades building up.
- When reporters fail to investigate for the victim (as in this high-profile operation) and insider threats ruin investigations, it can then fail to escalate operations to in-person to be validated,</a> here's the 'coercive control' of why...
- <i><b>Usually operations are not this long, volumnious, or deadly without ever being mitigated or acknowledged.</b></i> However, we can see the obsession to destroy victims to force them to recant through coercive control and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/investigator-barresi-opens-up-on-hollywood/">fixers</a>.
<br><i>- Often finding the sources and origins is looking for where the suspicious activities and parties 'slip up' in their predictability. A main issue is lacking experts to collect obvious and public data without extortion.</i>

## Private Sector: 
The motivations behind these operations suggest coercive control to take down these victims, their witnesses, and their support for decades, only now moved mostly online to avoid data analysis and oversight. The higher skill, natural language, and volume stems from the amounts of funds, specialties, and layers of companies used.
- E.g., attacking the partners of these figures has been happening for decades, e.g, with <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/investigator-barresi-opens-up-on-hollywood/">'Fixers,</a>' but not publicly researched before. It truly requires gamifying and deflecting with your own data, analysis, intelligence, and power. It can ruin, destroy, and destruct.
- At higher income levels, private security can be used against victims
- For the first time, we're confronting these issues harming these types of women/targets and establishing precedents of technologies which can be used. We can save lives by causing chain reactions of finally caring about these situations to prevent harms earlier.

## Evolving Subjective Interpretations - 
- <b>Connect the <b>Data Science/Social Network Analysis</b> with verifiable accounts, postings and analysis with <b>cybersecurity</b> (wayback machine, domain checking, etc), and cyber intelligence research. Have multiple experts cross-check.
- Social Cyber Security interconnects with the online and in-person worlds of escalations and origins.
- Social connects with the Technology and Data.</b>

### <b>Background Interpretations of Sources:</b> <br>

The main articles we based our studies on were on <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf">"Disinformation in the Private Sector: The Price of Influence"</a> and <a href="https://gadgets360.com/social-networking/news/devumi-a-firm-that-sells-fake-twitter-followers-to-be-probed-by-new-york-attorney-general-1805985">Devumi</a> bots - where public figures had millions of false followers and made copies of other people's biographies and personas. 

As seen in other case examples e.g., against actresses, models, socialites, and partners of atheletes, the Natural Language of these operations are similar as are their capabilities of paying hundreds of thousands to millions for these operations against women in these conditions.
<br>- Secondly, it's extreme monitoring with coercive control and domestic abuse by partners to not allow these women to move onto others. Private services and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1625097&page=1">'fixers'</a> specialize in harming women who are partners of these figures. It's abuse of process and intimidation to threaten with death, destruction.

<b>Private Sector - Connections to Sports accounts, Hollywood-Fixers, Bots, and <a href="https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/anthony-pellicano-wiretap-appeals-court-sentencing-1201578024/">Companies</a></b>:
- Sports accounts were not only seen by the cyber intelligence reseacher in April 2021 (Arsenal sports network), but also show in like-bots analysis.  
- Aside from the "Movie DC Monsters" Network shown on a peak day, entertainment and Hollywood-related liking-bots - with no statuses and only 'likes' - show in Twitter likes-analysis too. Clustering is a method to find similar topics, banners, and profile images.
- Though <a href="https://aiplexorm.com/online-reputation-management">AiPlex</a> took down videos of Amber Heard in Never Back Down suddenly after recent court news about her being raped, and Paul Barresi when sensing media contacts went to the <a href="https://thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/johnny-depp-should-walk-away-a-conversation-with-hollywood-fixer-paul-barresi/">only media outlet</a> writing to support Amber Heard against online bots, similar companies can be used. For example, <a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/harvey-weinstein-sitrick-and-company-crisis-response-1202584227/#!">Sitrick</a> was hired as a layer by an executive producer. 
- The determination early on to understand this is through being first alerted to the issues facing Amber Heard through that leaker on Twitter claiming to be a partner of an ex-staffer checking on her in March/April 2019. Very similarly to the intimidation of death of Amber Heard either before a trial, during a trial, or afterwards through this abuse of process, is the circumstances of missing Anthony Vivien Fox, which the leaker said staff are threatened about daily. Moreover, the other warnings of violence done towards her... 
<br>Years later, there's the <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins/Osint_Data%20Suspicious%20Origin%20Accounts/AmberHeardRUOk">"AmberHeardRUOK"</a> account which says, "Average person that takes time out to check on others, no matter who they are" created November 2021.

Along with the case's circumstances of intimidation, violence, missing people, high wealth of opposition, Hollywood fixers, and suspicious activities, the online world similarly has been made threatening to exploit the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">Data Void</a>.
<br><i>"Data voids are not unique to search engines; they occur on social media platforms, too."</i>

<b>Many Other Victims Seen from Understanding this Case</b> - E.g., Services like USA Forensics are used against other women in the fashion/music industries in Los Angeles. There are other services that other partners use which actors used. Imagine the audio editing leak in Feb 2020 - correlating with use of bots to amplify the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg/videos">edited/split audio</a> and a created channel - affecting many other women. We point to decades of skills. Where are the services helping these women and the understanding to the digital world?

### Private Sector:
 There are also examples of using other softwares and <a href="https://youtu.be/nojknljfvME">tampering strategies</a> from Hollywood fixers, e.g, against Nicole Kidman during her separation. 
- Using 'Timeline Comparisons - Events'.... Try to correlate the intensity of traits to how it changes in-person to be more restrictive, isolated, and difficult.
- Interestingly, activity shows on Decemer 28, 2021 on Anthony Fox's page at <a href="https://charleyproject.org/case/anthony-vivien-fox">the Charley Project</a>. 
<br><i>Witnesses for her, e.g., Melanie Inglessis, have been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amber-heards-makeup-artist-fighting-live-testimony-johnny-depps-uk-libel-trial-1296661/">afraid of providing video links</a> of tesifying <a href="https://wixlabs-pdf-dev.appspot.com/assets/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fpdfproxy%3Finstance%3Dh90FqYxRowo4LOaN6Gy0svFCBIny1NuRQ6vJ0SL0eZ0.eyJpbnN0YW5jZUlkIjoiMzQxZWY5OGUtZTBjZS00YzUwLWI4N2ItNGExODJiYjBiYzhkIiwiYXBwRGVmSWQiOiIxM2VlMTBhMy1lY2I5LTdlZmYtNDI5OC1kMmY5ZjM0YWNmMGQiLCJtZXRhU2l0ZUlkIjoiODBiMDgxNzEtY2U3My00NDg4LWIzNjktZmUzOTM0YjA1MDRhIiwic2lnbkRhdGUiOiIyMDIwLTA3LTIzVDAxOjUzOjE3LjA5NloiLCJkZW1vTW9kZSI6ZmFsc2UsImFpZCI6ImM5MjVkZTc3LTQ4ZjYtNDI2My04NDAyLWIyNTVlOWVlZjU5ZiIsImJpVG9rZW4iOiJiNGFlNzhmZi0yZWJkLTA4ZDgtMGIxMi1iNDIxMWYwMGVjYzciLCJzaXRlT3duZXJJZCI6IjVkZjUwNTBkLTQ1ZWQtNGFlZS1hMTU5LWIxODY5ZGZiMjk0YyJ9%26compId%3Dcomp-kcxs7142%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdocs.wixstatic.com%2Fugd%2F5df505_d1f4c2c65ff84b80b2a7cd173589abd9.pdf#page=1&links=true&originalFileName=Melanie%20Inglessis%20declaration&locale=en&allowDownload=true&allowPrinting=true">

### Weaponization of Disinformation/Influence Operations:
Similar to Kate Starbird's video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498-c_SjArg">"Emerging Technology Speaker Series - Beyond Bots and Trolls - Understanding Disinformation"</a> at Mozzila, the two sides of a issue are manipulated against the victims in influence operations. 
<br>Commonly personas of groups that should have actually supported her. It weaponizes these personas

#### Intimidation and Traits of Targeting:
- Operations, including psy-ops, are dangerous. The use of accounts and timings to invoke fear, hopelessness, and isolation are dangerous - see file "online social effects."
<br> It's imperative the victim doesn't look at the operations, requiring other parties. Think of frequency, target, source.

#### <b>Perspectives</b><br>
Sending a warp spiral through perspectives, the files here show gender violence which itself is painful to relive over and over. Anything she appears to have represented, or supported... 
<br>E.g., when she was an ambassador for Cyber Civil Rights - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://www.cybercivilrights.org/welcome/amber-heard-ccri-ambassador">page now removed</a> - she stated it was painful to have her images manipulated and exploited, yet everyday, she has to relive that through these operations. 
<br>We could see early there are bots on Twitter using botscores such as a petshop and Reddit sexualized accounts like 90police posting in seconds. However, imagine this instead further to threatening a life, attacking with mentions any social connection or business to her, and twisting continually. We move further...

<b>It's important to see that this influence is due to her ex-partner targetting her and it's not because of her coming forward. The volume, analysis, skill, and our data is enough to show this.</b>

The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire">Psy-Group</a> like operation focuses on usernames for 'likes/upvotes' which are related to her Natural Language/NLP. E.g., Reddit's 3rdPrizeIsYourFired, TruthBeThePrejudice, the-speed-of-pain, correlates to sudden 'likes' on Twitter like to b--respector, badcrippie, among others. The language on multiple platforms is similar. 
<br>However, groups like a Psy-Group go further to manipulate what people perceive.

### <b>A Psy-Group-like explanation, insider threats, and vulnerabilities</b><br>
The article on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire">Psy-Group</a> mentions understanding the vulnerabilities and exploitations of the social media companies. Perspectives has to do with emotions, angles, colors, verocity, amounts, timings, symbolism, etc. 
- It's interesting that in 2019 when hired to content review, a male comedian and JD were case examples for using the Bing API to remove accounts if fake, and it was in an interview about studying the cyber abuse, yet the abuse against AH was not removed. The companies have differing cultures themselves - e.g., ex-Google and ex-Twitter interns or workers can be more helpful to us while Facebook was more challenging, not removing anything unlike Reddit, Twitter, YouTube/Giphy. Never the less, cybersecurity would have responded. Since Nov 2019, it's been suspicious of infiltration.
- When McGowan's credit history was removed, it was stated it could likely be an insider in FinTech. It also felt like chats could be synced to cause fear of commmunications with her. 
- Hollywood Fixer Anthony Pellicano's - related to a predictable Paul Barresi who is attacking Amber Heard by exploiting generational ignorance - history mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Pellicano#cite_note-Resentence-20">software</a> early on.

<b>Threat analysis</b> and our studies shows the timelines to escalations of risks with keywords, phrases use. Hundreds of thousands of threatening texts exist against Amber Heard on the 6 platforms. In examples, within tens of thousands of repeated same texts on YouTube, false interactions on all platforms, and cryptic bot networks are people brought into them to threaten Amber Heard. 
<br> We show increases of threats and escalations - even in spite of her winning in cases or gaps of announcements. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/kTTqIqqqRjA?t=89">(Video Coded Bias: Voting Experiment on Social Media)</a></i>

#### <b>"High Risk" preventing stopping the Private Sector operations through political confusion:</b>
- The use of Waldman is a decoy from finding the layers of companies, services, and it's used to terrify Amber Heard. The organizations, nonprofits she was with don't know how to combat operations. 
- <b>To ruin a person like Amber Heard who had recently gained ambassador positions of organizations, United Nations Human Rights Champion position, required significant volume, time, and skill. </b>A large issue is knowlege of how to exploit and intimidate. 
- A majority of Social Network Analysis - e.g., <a href="https://www.insna.org/socnet">SOCNET</a> - is around elections or general broad issues instead of abuse and crime.
- Second, political ploys are used to scare and to intimidate, as well as to lock into a space without a solution. There are no political views to our scientists and analysts. We leave this out because it's a trap. In targeting situations, so-called 'movements' created are actually done to mask targeting individuals. Their ultimate goal is to prevent interference from helping the victims. 

### <b>Technology/AI is Easier on Public Figures</b>

Bots can be used without APIs, but with layers of companies and services, it's likely both, similar to Devumi e.g. Since Amber Heard is a public figure, it's <a href="https://semiosis.github.io/apostrophe/">shown by a top Artificial Intelligence Researcher</a> that it's easier to create language on her than less-known people. What's webscraped online for the language models is stored. This would make it easier along with the decades of history already to attack her with skill and precision. There is a higher volume, and essentially, personas of figures can be chosen for the botchats. E.g., through Davinci codex, GPT-3, etc. 
- A Cambridge Analytica reporter was tipped early on, but from the perspective of the tech industry after 6 years of learning especially from this project, the social media companies actually should be very eager to stop this cyber crime and remove it from their systems if properly channeled. Notice - Cambridge emphasized APIs which aren't required.

<b>As technology researchers interested in ethics and social effects of tech, we do want this to be an example for positive change instead of destruction. It needs to be investigated and mitigated.</b>


## <b>Questions:</b>
 1. What other case studies can you think of similar to this one?
<br>2. How can the different layers be analyzed, and unarguably presented? Can you correlate the data, timings of the NLP to multiple types of evidence?
<br>3. How can the Data Science, Cybersecurity, Private and Public interests remove gaps in stopping these types of operations?
<br>4. How does the online data and motivations correlate to threats and predictable actions in previous instances from the related individuals?
<br>5. How can we prevent similar operations to save lives and stop the distress of the victim by mitigating the harms?

- Collect data and quantifications evidence, then reverse engineer why/origins, and collect suspicious activities throughout for ethical experts, including in other studies.
